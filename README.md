The Sales Forecasting App is a simple yet powerful tool that predicts future sales trends based on past data. It allows users to upload a dataset (like monthly or weekly sales), and the app uses basic statistical and machine learning techniques to forecast upcoming sales.

This project was developed as part of my personal learning journey during my freshman year, while I was exploring the fundamentals of Python programming and introductory statistics. Building it helped me understand real-world applications of concepts like regression, data visualization, and trend analysis.
